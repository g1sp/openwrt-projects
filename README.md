# OpenWrt projects

Four projects for OpenWrt / home network demos:

- **network-sentinel** — Plain-English threat briefings from firewall/DNS logs (templates + optional SLM).
- **router-assistant** — CLI and voice: natural-language phrases → UCI/firewall actions (keyword matching).
- **home-copilot-demo** — MacBook demo: local SLM (Ollama) with simulated router context; single-page UI.
- **instant-fix** — "Why is Zoom freezing?" — explanation + suggested fix from telemetry; suggests 5 GHz and reset network settings, never reboot router.

See each subfolder's README for run and install instructions.
